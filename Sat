Dear Heavenly Father, 

It's a letter to you. You know that I have sinned greatly againest you. This week I do not know what kind of life I have lived. I endulged myself in GAY porn which is shameful and I want to shun. I tried to shun from evil but I failed. Everyy time the Devil entice my heart to watch the videos I was already told not to watch, but I just have no power to defend against the attack. Can you forgive my sin, my great transgressions? Can you give me a wife, a wife that you think are it for me? I know I am far from qualified to ask you about this. But you know my weakness, all my considerations. Could you please forgive your servant, let me see the girl again. You have arranged many girls in the Church, however, I am rebellous. But without passion can the love last? Oh my Lord, could you please answer my question, after waiting for so long. I experienced so long time and my mom and dad have been waiting for so long. Oh my LORD, can I see the girl again? I know if you are willing, I can see that girl, because you are Almighty God. I know your great power. But I am afraid that you think it improper to meet that girl. Oh my Lord I am in great distress. Save me, oh Lord, from my great transgresions, and give me power to defend against the Devil. Lord, give me a girl, a wife that can overpower the addiction to handsome men. Lord, Save me. Lord, Save me. I am waiting for your will. If you are not willing, do not let me see that girl again this week, but give me a willing heart to obey you, Lord. If you are willing, let me see that girl again and let that girl believe you, because you are the Almighty God. Dear Father, answer my prayer. Lord, Thank you!
Your Dear Son
Amen!
